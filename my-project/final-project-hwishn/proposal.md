# [Exciting Trivia Game]

Author: [Hannah Wishnew]

    For my project I want to create an interactive trivia game. 
My background with this project is that I have developed apps and games before 
for android using Android Studio and Unity. I am also motivated to finish this 
project because I love trivia about all of my interests and my family plays 
trivia games together all the time.

For this project the external libraries I want to use are the TUIO cinder block 
and the Jsoncpp libraries.This will allow me to develop a UI for the game and easily render it to a 
computer and allow users to interact with the game. The link for the block's 
github repository is: https://github.com/cinder/Cinder/tree/master/blocks/TUIO
    
I expect the timeline for this project to be similar to what I lay out below:
week 1:set up the UI for the game and handle user interactions
week 2:set up json functionally to read questions and answers from a json file 
week 3:set up game engine/game functionality 
    
If I am done early I can add functionality for the user to create their own 
custom games with questions and answers they write. I could also create a leader
board so users can compare their scores for different games.
